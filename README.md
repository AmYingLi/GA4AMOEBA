# GA4AMOEBA
This the Genetic Algorithm program for optimzing the AMOEBA force field

(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4003702). Specially for the

electrostatics parameters (based on methoanl dimer data) and the vdW 

parameters (based on the methanol oligomers data). It's a MPI program, 

which runs on high performance computers most effectively. So far, the 

script provided works on http://status.alcf.anl.gov/cooley/activity and 

https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/systems/resources/blues/. Please contact 

yingli@anl.gov or roux@uchicago.edu, if you have any question regarding 

the code.

Again, this git repository only contains documentation(including source 

files and running scripts) and examples for methanol electrostatics and 

vdW parameters for AMOEBA force field.
