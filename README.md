# GA4AMOEBA
This is a Machine Leaning (ML) Genetic Algorithm GA) program for optimizing the parameters of a polarizable force field based on the  AMOEBA functional form (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4003702).  It is a MPI program that can be executed on high performance computers. The ML/GA scripts were utilized computers at Argonne National Laboratory, on http://status.alcf.anl.gov/cooley/activity andhttps://www.lcrc.anl.gov/systems/resources/blues/. Please contact yingli@anl.gov or roux@uchicago.edu, if you have any question regarding the code.
