# GA4AMOEBA
This the Genetic Algorithm program for optimzing the AMOEBA force field\n
(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4003702). Specially for the\n
electrostatics parameters (based on methoanl dimer data) and the vdW\n 
parameters (based on the methanol oligomers data). It's a MPI program,\n 
which runs on high performance computers most effectively. So far, the\n
script provided works on http://status.alcf.anl.gov/cooley/activity and\n 
https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/systems/resources/blues/. Please contact\n
yingli@anl.gov or roux@uchicago.edu, if you have any question regarding\n 
the code.\n
\n
Again, this git repository only contains documentation(including source\n
files and running scripts) and examples for methanol electrostatics and\n 
vdW parameters for AMOEBA force field.\n
