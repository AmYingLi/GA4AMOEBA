# GA4AMOEBA
This the Genetic Algorithm program for optimzing the AMOEBA force field (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4003702). Specially for the electrostatics parameters (based on methoanl dimer data) and the vdW parameters (based on the methanol oligomers data). It's a MPI program, which runs on high performance computers most effectively. So far, the script provided works on cooley.alcf.anl.gov and blues.lcrc.anl.gov. Please contact yingli@anl.gov or roux@uchicago.edu, if you have any question regarding the code.
